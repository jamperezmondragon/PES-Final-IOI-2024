    \hh{Problem}
    
        You are given an integer $N$ and $N - 1$ bidirectional edges with weights. These edges connect $N$ vertices in such a way that there is a path\footnote{A path is defined as a sequence of vertices, such that for any two consecutive vertices, there is an edge connecting them.} between any two vertices (i.e. they form a tree). For all paths, we define their weight as the product of the number of edges in it and the {\bfseries greatest common divisor} of each of the weights of the edges in the path. Determine the simple path (a path that does not repeat edges) with the maximum weight.
    
    \hh{Implementation Details}

        You must implement the function \textit{Arbolstian()}. This function receives an integer $N$ and 3 vectors $u, v$ and $w$ with $N - 1$ elements For each $0 \le i \le N - 2$, $u[i]$ and $v[i]$ are the vertices that are connected by the edge $i$, and $w[i]$ is it's weight. This function must return an integer, the maximum weight of a path in the tree.
        Your program should look like this:

\begin{minted}{c++}
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

long long int Arbolstian(int N, vector<int> u, vector<int> v, vector<int> w) {
    // Implement this function.
}
    
\end{minted}

    The grader will call the function \textbf{multiple} times per test case.

    \hh{Examples}
    
        {\itshape Example 1:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The grader calls the function

                    \textit{Arbolstian(6, \{0, 0, 0, 2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, \{2, 2, 4, 2, 4\})} 
            \end{center}
