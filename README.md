# Competition

This problems were used to determine the Mexican team for the 36th International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) in a training camp we organized in Mexico city. We also invited other IOI teams to try the problems virtually, we organized two rounds. One exact mirror, and another round with the hardest problems (+ some other problems choosen by Singapore's coaches) from the set. In total, 112 contestants from 20 different countries participated. Here's the static rankings:
